        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at George Mason University.  
            During my time in school, I have been participating in hackathons, pursuing internships such as my internship at Mastercard, 
            and being a board member of my university's Anime and Gaming Club.
             </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I have 5+ years of experience programming with Java and 2+ years with Python. I participated in web development projects as part of the frontend team, thus utilizing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create functioning and robust landing pages. I also assisted the backend team in deploying our web applications using Django and Flask and integrating SQL for our database.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I have used various technical tools such as AndroidStudio, VisualStudioCode, and Eclipse, as well as libraries such as React to create a long list of projects - both for school and for personal use.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I am currently looking for opportunities to apply my current working knowledge and to grow as a professional in the tech industry, particularily            entry-level positions in QA Testing, Database Management, and Full-Stack 
            Web Development. </p>
